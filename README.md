## Description
The purpose of my project is that users can chat with their friends online.
<br>
Users can add friends and chat with them online. In the chat, users can share photos, videos, audio and documents with each other. There is a user reporting system.
<br>
I used the Django framework of the Python programming language in the backend of the project. I used Django channels for real-time asynchronous messaging.
<br>
I used javascript and jquery on the frontend.
